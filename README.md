## Escrow Contract

The escrow contract facilitates secure task execution through a bonding mechanism. The deployer first funds the contract with reward and payment tokens, then executors can bond by depositing tokens worth at least half the reward amount. Once bonded, the executor has five minutes to complete the task and provide proof to collect their bond plus the reward and payment. If the deadline passes without collection, subsequent bonds automatically claim the expired bond amount as additional reward. The deployer retains control through cancellation mechanisms and can withdraw excess funds while preserving the reward amount for successful task completion.
